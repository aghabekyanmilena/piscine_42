# 42 Piscine: C Projects

My repository for **42 Piscine C projects (C00â€“C08)**! ðŸš€  
This journey was a deep dive into **C programming**,
focusing on problem-solving, memory management, and algorithmic thinking.

## Projects Overview

Each folder (C00â€“C08) represents a unique module, with progressively challenging exercises aimed at mastering core programming concepts:

- **C00:** Basics of C - `ft_putchar`, `ft_print_alphabet`, and loops.
- **C01:** Memory and pointers - `ft_swap`, string manipulation.
- **C02:** String validation functions.
- **C03:** Advanced strings - `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcmp`, and more.
- **C04:** Handling strings and input/output operations.
- **C05:** Recursion - Factorials, Fibonacci, and other recursive challenges.
- **C06:** Command-line arguments (argc and argv)
- **C07:** Advanced memory - Dynamic allocation and `ft_split`.
- **C08:** Header files.

## Highlights âœ¨

- Gained strong proficiency in **C programming**.
- Enhanced debugging, memory management, and logical thinking skills.
- Built robust projects emphasizing **peer collaboration** and **self-learning**.

Each project folder contains its respective exercises and solutions.
